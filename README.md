## DynaDungeons

Bomberman clone using the awesome open source [Godot](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot) game engine (MIT-licensed), and using the nice [Bomb Party tileset](http://opengameart.org/content/bomb-party-the-complete-set) from OpenGameArt (CC BY 3.0).

The project is at an early stage of development; the first objective is to reimplement the well-known gameplay of games of the Bomberman series. A further objective might be to extend the gameplay by adding RPG elements and maybe different multiplayer modes such as Capture the Flag.

Those are mostly ideas so far, and this is a learning project to get familiar with Godot and game development, so don't put your hopes too high. ;-)
